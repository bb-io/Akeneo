## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

Akeneo’s PIM (Product Information Management) solution is designed to ingest, normalize, enrich, and centralize product information. It provides enterprise-grade data modeling, governance, and workflows to ensure consistent and high-quality product data management across various channels.

## Before settings up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an active Akeneo instance and you have sufficient rights to add apps to it.
- Go to _Connect_ -> _App Store_ and click on _Create an app_ in the top right corner.
- Give your app a name, for example "Blackbird".
- The activate URL is irrelevant for Blackbird, you can give it the Blackbird login URL like `https://de-1.blackbird.io`.
- For the callback URL fill in `https://bridge.blackbird.io/api/AuthorizationCode`.
- You will receive a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`. Copy and save these values for the next steps.
